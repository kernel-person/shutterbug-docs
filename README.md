# ShutterBug Docs

Public user and admin documentation for the ShutterBug Minecraft plugin.

## Local Preview

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Publish

The included GitHub Actions workflow builds the MkDocs site and publishes it to GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch.

After the first successful workflow run, enable Pages in the repository settings:

- Source: Deploy from branch
- Branch: `gh-pages`
- Folder: `/`

Then set the published URL in the ShutterBug plugin config:

```yml
guide-url: 'https://kernel-person.github.io/shutterbug-docs/'
```
